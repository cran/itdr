#' Recumbent cows
#' @description 
#' For unknown reasons, pregnant dairy cows can become
#'recumbent-they lie down-either shortly before or after calving. This condition
#'can be serious, and frequently leads to death of the cow. Clark, Henderson,
#'Hoggard, Ellison and Young (1987) analyze data collected at the Ruakura (N.Z.)
#'Animal Health Laboratory on a sample of recumbent cows.
